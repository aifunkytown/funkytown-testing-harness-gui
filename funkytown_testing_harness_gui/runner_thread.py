"""Runs funkytown_testing_harness.run_test.run() on a background thread so
the UI stays responsive (fetching/converting the workflow and queuing can
take a few seconds), and captures its print()-based progress output into the
log panel instead of the real console. run() calls sys.exit() on error
conditions (e.g. fewer than 2 models present) - that raises SystemExit, which
is caught here and reported through the same signal as any other failure
rather than killing the thread silently.
